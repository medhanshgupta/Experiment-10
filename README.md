## Aim:  Study of Pandas library

## Theory: 
Pandas is an essential, open-source Python library for data analysis and manipulation.    
pd.Series(): Creates a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.   
pd.DataFrame(): Creates a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and tabular data structure with labeled axes.   
df.shape: An attribute that returns a tuple representing the dimensionality of the DataFrame.   
df.ndim: Returns an integer representing the number of axes/dimensions.    
df.columns: Returns the column labels of the DataFrame.    
df.dtypes: Returns the data types of each column.     
df.loc[row_index, "ColumnName"]: Accesses a group of rows and columns by labels or a boolean array.    
df.iloc[row_index, col_index]: Accesses a group of rows and columns by integer-based positions.    
df.drop(): Removes specified rows or columns. In the notebook, axis=1 is used to specify a column removal.    
df.mean(): Calculates the average of the values in a column.    
df.max(): Returns the highest value in a column.    
df.min(): Returns the lowest value in a column.     
df[df["Marks"] > 80]:  It filters the DataFrame to show only the rows where the condition (Marks greater than 80) is true.    

## Conclusion:
Hence pandas library were implented in python and operations were done using them.
